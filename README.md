# ðŸ—¿ Garry's Mod Fan Site

## ðŸ“ƒ Description

This is a simple website I made with HTML and CSS, based on the amazing sandbox game Garry's Mod. I started this project as a simple test page for practicing with flexbox.

I wanted to play around with some colors and elements, and ended up making a prototype of sorts, just a bunch of colored squares and circles. After messing around with some shades of blue, I said to myself "I need to make a Garry's Mod themed site", and, well, it's here! Ironically, this ended being my little sandbox to put in practice the stuff I learned.
